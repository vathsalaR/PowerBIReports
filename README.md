# PowerBIReports

<p>Hi, this a repository containing sample data, dashboards and reports built using Power Bi.<p>

1. The first report, **The Sales and Profit** dashboard and report analyze retail sales data of items sold across multiple stores and districts. The metrics compare this year’s performance to last year’s in these areas: sales, units, gross margin, and variance, as well as new store analysis. This is real data from gathered from obviEnce as a course project for Edx'x Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI course.

2. My Second Report is the **WHO_SpendData**, In this example we take Imade use of some of the World Health Organization world wide expenditure data that is freely available to download from http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/. In the demo I displayed some features of Power BI such as forecasting,grouping / binning, Top N filtering etc.

3. My third report, **Weather Analysis**, is an interactive dashboard built using the weather data provided by NOAA, showcasing Average High and Low Temperatures across the United States from 2010 through 2016 (July). I have designed to look at the average temperatures by state over time, and compare it to daily precipitations.
